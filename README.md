I did my Summer Internship project at **Oil And Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC), Dehradun** on **Satellite Communication**. ONGC needs to deploy advanced technology in all facets of its multidisciplinary activities, to sustain efficiency of operations and to remain competitive in the emerging open economy. As a part of the IT Strategy, ONGC has set up its own captive communication network comprising of both Terrestrial as well as Satellite based systems connecting its various work centers spread over the country.
